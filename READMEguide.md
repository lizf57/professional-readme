# PROJECT-TITLE-HERE

# Description
A high quality README file is a key component to every repository. The README is the first file shown on a Github repo and shows users what the application does, how it was created, why it was created, and what problem does this application fix?

  ## Table-of-Contents

  A table of contents will be needed if your README is long because it will be easier for users to navigate through. 
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [Contributions](#contributions)
  * [Tests](#tests)
  * [Questions](#questions)


  ## [Installation](#Table-of-Contents)
  Here you will list the steps required to install your project. Step-by-step instructions are helpful, as well, as including links. 


  ## [Usage](#Table-of-Contents)
 Provide instructions and exmples about using the application. Include screenshots if neccessary. 

 To include an image to your README, first create a separate folder in your repo titled 'assets' and then a folder called 'images.' Then, upload your screenshot or image to the folder. Then, using the relative file path, you'll use the following code in your repo:
 
 ![insert name of image](assets/images/screenshot.png) 

(to view code, make sure your are viewing in code in raw and not preview)

  ## [Tests](#Table-of-Contents)
Write tests for your application and provide instructions and examples how to run them.

  ## [Questions](#Table-of-Contents)
