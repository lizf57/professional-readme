# Professional README Generator 

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a README template that is simple and professional. By designing a template, I can be more efficient and consistent by focusing on the important aspects needed to use and understand the application. 

  ## Table of Contents

  ## [Installation](#Table-of-Contents)
  The link listed below is a direct link to the repository. 
  
  [README Generator Link](https://github.com/lizf57/professional-readme)

  Once the link is clicked, you'll be brought to the repository on Github. Click the dropdown arrow on the green "code" button and clone the repo using your terminal. Once the repo is cloned, open it in VS code, or your choice of editor, and get started!


  ## [Usage](#Table-of-Contents)
  Once the application is installed, run the following code in the terminal: 'node index.js'. Answer the questions/prompts until a message says 'File created!'
